\opening{Dear prospective employer:}

I am interested in the part-time research engineering position with posting number 17--08--31--01--4207.
Working as an acoustic analyst part-time is appealing because this would
    allow me to leverage my skillset and
    supplement my income while I simultaneously work at a start-up non-profit.
Given your listed requirements and preferred qualifications for the applicant,
I believe that I am an excellent candidate and deserving of your consideration.

This position requires a background in acoustic signal analysis in Matlab, and as my r\'{e}sum\'{e} will show,
I have experience in this area through my education and practical work experience.
I graduated with a master's degree in Digital Signal Processing through the competitive Communications and Networking Systems department at the University of Texas.
As a graduate researcher,
I conducted novel research into adaptive array beamforming for the purpose of mitigating interference in multi-user communication networks.
Most importantly,
I worked as an acoustic analyst in the Advanced Technology Laboratory at Applied Research Laboratories (ARL).
Here I developed
    an intuitive understanding of the signal processing steps involved in circular array beamforming and
    an appreciation for the extremely harsh oceanic acoustic propagation environment.
I left this role at ARL because I was interested in exploring a better work-life balance, but
I always found the problem area interesting and would be delighted to work there again in a part-time capacity.

I would be pleased to further discuss my qualifications and to learn more about the position through an interview.
I live in Austin and will be able to accommodate any schedule during regular work hours.
Please contact me through my cellphone at (512) 237--7562 or through my email \vbox{\href{mailto:jonstarr@utexas.edu}{jonstarr@utexas.edu}.}
Thank you for this opportunity and for your consideration.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\encl{r\'{e}sum\'{e} and list of references}
