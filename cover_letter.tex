\opening{Dear prospective employer:}

I am interested in the part-time mathematics tutoring position with job number 1503001.
I am interested in working for Austin Community College because
I would like to help others master difficult subjects and, in doing so,
help them achieve their education goals.
Given your listed requirements and preferred qualifications for the applicant,
I believe that I am an excellent candidate and deserving of your consideration.

The position requires a background in tutoring and mathematics, and as my resume will show,
I have experience in these areas through my education and practical work experience.
While I was a graduate research assistant at the University of Texas at Austin, for example,
I worked as a student mentor for the electrical engineering senior capstone class, where I provided
technical assistance,
supervision, and
grading
to students pursuing their senior capstone project.
Additionally, through my studies as an engineering bachelor's and master's student,
I have developed a strong background in theoretical and applied mathematics.

I would be pleased to further discuss my qualifications and to learn more about the position through an interview.
I live in Austin and will be able to accommodate any schedule during regular work hours.
Please contact me through my cellphone at (512) 237-7562 or through my email \vbox{\href{mailto:jonstarr@utexas.edu}{jonstarr@utexas.edu}.}
Thank you for this opportunity and for your consideration.

\closing{Yours Faithfully,}
